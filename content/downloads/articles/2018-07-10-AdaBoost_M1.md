Summary: This notebook explores the well known **AdaBoost M1** algorithm which combines several weak classifiers to create a better overall classifier. The notebook consists of three main sections: A review of the Adaboost M1 algorithm and an intuitive visualization of its inner workings. An implementation from scratch in Python, using an Sklearn decision tree stump as the weak classifier. A discussion on the trade-off between the Learning rate and Number of weak classifiers parameters
