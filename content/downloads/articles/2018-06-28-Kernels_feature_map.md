Summary: Following the series on SVM, we will now explore the theory and intuition behind Kernels and Feature maps, showing the link between the two as well as advantages and disadvantages. The notebook is divided into two main sections: 1. Theory, derivations and pros and cons of the two concepts. 2. An intuitive and visual interpretation in 3 dimensions
