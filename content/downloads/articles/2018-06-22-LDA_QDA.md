Author: Xavier Bourret Sicotte
Summary: Exploring the theory and implementation behind two well known generative classification algorithms. Linear discriminative analysis (LDA) and Quadratic discriminative analysis (QDA). This notebook will use the Iris dataset as a case study for comparing and visualizing the prediction boundaries of the algorithms
