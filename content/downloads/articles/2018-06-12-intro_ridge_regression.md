Author: Xavier Bourret Sicotte
Summary: This notebook is the first of a series exploring regularization for linear regression, and in particular ridge and lasso regression. We will focus here on ridge regression with some notes on the background theory and mathematical derivations and python numpy implementation. Finally we will provide visualizations of the cost functions with and without regularization to help gain an intuition as to why ridge regression is a solution to poor conditioning and numerical stability.
