Summary: In this second notebook on SVMs we will walk through the implementation of both the hard margin and soft margin SVM algorithm in Python using the well known CVXOPT library. While the algorithm in its mathematical form is rather straightfoward, its implementation in matrix form using the CVXOPT API can be challenging at first. This notebook will show the steps required to derive the appropriate vectorized notation as well as the inputs needed for the API.
