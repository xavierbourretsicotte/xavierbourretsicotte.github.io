Summary: This notebook simulates the impact of early peaking on the results of a conversion rate AB test. Early peaking is loosely defined as the practice of checking and concluding the results of an AB test (i.e. based on its p value, statistical significance, secondary metrics etc) before the target sample size and power are reached.
