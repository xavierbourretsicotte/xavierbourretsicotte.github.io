Author: Xavier Bourret Sicotte
Summary: Description of the algorithm and derivation of the implementation of Coordinate descent for linear regression in Python. Visualization of the "staircase" steps using surface and contour plots as well as a simple animation. This implementation will serve as a step towards more complex use cases such as Lasso.
